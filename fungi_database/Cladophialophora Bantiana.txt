A fungal infection of the brain, usually caused by Cladophialophora bantiana, Exophiala dermatitidis, or Rhinocladiella mackenziei. It leads to black, necrotic brain tissue, black pus, and dark cerebrospinal fluid. Infection usually spreads through the blood or lymph but can also occur by direct inoculation. Symptoms include headache, fever, weakness on one side of the body, seizures, and sometimes behavioral changes. Brain scans often show ring-shaped lesions. Can be treated with a combination of antifungal drugs and surgical removal of infected tissue.
