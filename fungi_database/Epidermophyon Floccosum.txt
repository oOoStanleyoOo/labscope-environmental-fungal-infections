A genus of filamentous fungi that causes superficial skin and nail infections. The main species, Epidermophyton floccosum, is anthropophilic, living on the human body and spreading by direct contact or contaminated surfaces like gym floors, towels, or salon tools. It does not infect hair but commonly causes ringworm of the body (tinea corporis), athlete’s foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), and nail infections (onychomycosis). Most cases are mild or self-limiting, but symptoms can include itchy, scaly, red patches with sharp borders or thickened, brittle nails. Treatment is usually topical antifungal creams (clotrimazole, miconazole, terbinafine). More severe or persistent cases may require oral terbinafine or itraconazole.
