A systemic fungal infection caused by Paracoccidioides species, a dimorphic fungus endemic to Central and South America, especially in Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. The fungus lives in soil and is acquired mainly by inhaling spores. Most infections are silent, but some progress to disease. There are two main forms: an acute/subacute form in children and young adults with fever, weight loss, lymph node swelling, and organ involvement; and a chronic form in adults that usually affects the lungs, mouth, and skin. PCM can cause mucosal ulcers, pulmonary fibrosis, and widespread granulomas. Men are far more commonly affected than women, likely due to hormonal protection. Diagnosis is made by identifying characteristic “pilot’s wheel” budding yeast. Treatment is long-term with antifungals such as itraconazole (preferred), voriconazole, ketoconazole, or amphotericin B for severe cases. Untreated disease can be disabling or fatal, though most patients survive with proper therapy.
