A subcutaneous fungal infection caused by Sporothrix species, including S. schenckii and S. brasiliensis. The fungus lives on plants and soil and infects people through cuts or scratches. Most cases occur in tropical and subtropical regions, but outbreaks also happen after flooding or from cat scratches in South America, especially Brazil. Symptoms include nodules or plaques on the skin that may ulcerate, often spreading along lymphatic vessels (“sporotrichoid spread”). Rarely, the infection can cause arthritis, respiratory illness, or meningitis. Sporotrichosis is not usually life-threatening and can be treated with itraconazole or terbinafine. Severe cases may require amphotericin B.
