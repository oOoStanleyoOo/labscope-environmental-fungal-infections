A common fungal infection of the skin. It is caused by an overgrowth of yeast that normally lives on the skin. Many people have this yeast without problems, but in hot, humid weather or with a weakened immune system it can grow out of control. Symptoms include small discolored patches that may be white, pink, red, brown, or yellow, usually on the chest, back, neck, or shoulders. The patches may be mildly itchy and more visible after sun exposure. Tinea versicolor is not harmful or contagious. It can be treated with antifungal creams, shampoos, or oral medicines such as clotrimazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, or itraconazole.
