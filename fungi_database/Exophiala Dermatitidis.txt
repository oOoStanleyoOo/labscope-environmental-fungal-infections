A species of black yeast fungi. It can cause superficial, subcutaneous, or invasive infections. Many people come into contact with this fungus in moist environments such as bathrooms and dishwashers and experience little to no problems. However, if your immune system is weakened by HIV/AIDS, cystic fibrosis, cancer, or organ transplants, there is an increased chance of infection. Symptoms include airway problems, skin nodules or ulcers, and in rare cases meningitis. Can be treated with antifungals such as voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B.
