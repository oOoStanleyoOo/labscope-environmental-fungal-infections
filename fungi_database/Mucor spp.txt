A serious fungal infection caused by mucormycetes. These fungi live in soil, plants, and decaying matter and rarely cause illness in healthy people. However, if your immune system is weakened by diabetes, cancer, organ transplants, or steroid use, you are at high risk. Mucormycosis can infect the sinuses, eyes, brain, lungs, stomach, skin, or spread throughout the body. Symptoms include fever, headache, sinus pain, swelling around the eyes, cough with blood, chest pain, blackened skin lesions, or confusion if the brain is involved. The infection is often fatal without rapid treatment. It is treated with antifungal medications such as amphotericin B, posaconazole, or isavuconazole, often combined with surgery to remove infected tissue.
