A chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by dematiaceous (pigmented) fungi such as Fonsecaea and Cladophialophora. It occurs after traumatic skin injury with contaminated soil or plant material in tropical and subtropical areas. The infection begins as small red or pink spots and slowly progresses to warty, cauliflower-like plaques or nodules that may ulcerate. Diagnosis is made by identifying thick-walled pigmented fungal cells (sclerotic or “copper penny” bodies) in tissue. Chromoblastomycosis is a neglected tropical disease and can lead to disabling fibrosis, secondary infections, and even skin cancer if untreated. Mild cases may be treated with surgical excision, while moderate to severe cases require long-term antifungals such as itraconazole or terbinafine. Treatment is often prolonged and recurrences are common.
